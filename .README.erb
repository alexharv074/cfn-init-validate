# AWS::CloudFormation::Init RSpec validation

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/alexharv074/cfn-init-validate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/alexharv074/cfn-init-validate)

## Overview

A proof of concept using RSpec to validate AWS::CloudFormation::Init configurations.

## What it does
<%-
  code = %x[gsed -n '

            /^\$types/,/^}/ {
              s/#.*//
              p
            }

            ' spec/validate_spec.rb]

  lines = %x[gsed -n '

            /^\$types/,/^}/ {
              /^\$types/=
              /^}/=
            }

            ' spec/validate_spec.rb].sub(/\n/,'-').chomp
-%>

Based on documentation [here](docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html), I have reduced the AWS::CloudFormation::Init configuration to a specification in [this](./spec/validate_spec.rb#L<%= lines -%>) Ruby Hash in the RSpec test file:

```ruby
<%= code -%>
```

I take this to be a concise specification of all valid AWS::CloudFormation::Init configurations.

The contents of the AWS::CloudFormation::Init is then recursively compared against this structure. Data types and regular expressions in the structure are taken as placeholders for real data and data is validated against these. A few other bits and pieces are also validated.

For more information, everything interesting is in the source code in [spec/validate_spec.rb](./spec/validate_spec.rb) and [test_runner.sh](./test_runner.sh).

## Dependencies

To run the demo you need:

- Ruby (tested on Ruby 2.1.4)
- Rubygems
- Bundler
- Python
- Virtualenv
- Make

## Demo

To run the demo:

```text
▶ make
```

The test runner will download a bunch of example CloudFormation templates with AWS::CloudFormation::Init blocks and validate them.

## Usage

To validate your own CloudFormation template:

- Clone this project and cd to the project root.

- Save your template as `cloudformation.yml`.

- If necessary, convert it from JSON (look in `test_runner.sh` to understand how to do that).

- Then:

```text
▶ bundle install
▶ bundle exec rake
```

Or, just fork this project and use `spec/validate_spec.rb` in your own project.

## Known issues

Use of If conditionals to populate fields within the AWS::CloudFormation::Init config will cause fields to appears as Arrays instead of Booleans etc. For example, [here](https://github.com/widdix/aws-cf-templates/blob/master/ec2/ec2-auto-recovery.yaml#L540-L541).
